# 👋 Hi, I’m @snapshot-site

🚀 **Snapshot Site** is a fast, scalable API that lets you take high-resolution, full-page screenshots of any website — programmatically.

---

## 👀 I’m interested in:
- Web automation and headless browser technologies (Puppeteer, Chrome Headless)
- High-performance APIs & low-latency rendering
- Serverless and scalable infrastructure on AWS
- SaaS platforms & developer-friendly tooling
- SEO tooling and site monitoring via screenshots

## 🌱 I’m currently improving:
- Stealth mode & anti-bot fingerprinting
- Dynamic autoscaling of screenshot services in Docker/Kubernetes
- Dual-stack (IPv4/IPv6) API endpoint support
- Capture stability for highly dynamic or JS-heavy sites

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Open-source tooling for automated visual regression testing
- Puppeteer plugins or alternatives in Rust/Go
- Edge-caching strategies (CloudFront, BunnyCDN, etc.)

## ⚡ Fun fact:
We use real browsers in the cloud to capture what bots can't see. Your site might look different when JS is disabled — ours won't miss a pixel 😉.
